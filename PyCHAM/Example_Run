These instructions can be followed to check that the code is functioning.  They should be followed once the set-up steps in the README (instructions i) to v) inclusive) have been completed.

i) in the command prompt/terminal: python PyCHAM.py
ii) select the Example_Run.txt file from the inputs folder as the Chemical Scheme .txt File
iii) select the Example_Run_xml.xml file from the inputs folder as the Chemical Scheme .xml File
iv) select the Example_Run_inputs.txt from the inputs folder as the Model Variables .txt File
v) select the 'Run Model' button.
vi) the results will be saved in the folder output/Example_Run/Model_Test.
vii) now use the Plot Results button to show and save two plots to the output/Example_Run/Model_Test folder: one with the time profile of the: SOA mass, particle number concentration and number size distribution (called contours.png) and one with the time profile of ozone and alpha-pinene gas-phase concentrations (called gas_ppb.png)
viii) compare these plots with original_contours.png and original_gas_ppb.png saved in output/Example_Run - if plots differ the code is not identical to the original
